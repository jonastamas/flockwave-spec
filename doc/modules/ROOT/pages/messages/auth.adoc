= `AUTH` — Authentication-related messages

The messages in this section are concerned with _authentication_, i.e. the
process or action of verifying the identity of the user that is connecting to
the Flockwave server.

Each connection to a Flockwave server MAY have exactly one corresponding
identity. Connections start as unauthenticated by default (except in
special cases when the identity of the user who connects to the server can
be established from the connection handshake, e.g., in the case of TLS
authentication with client certificates). If the server is configured in a
way that it accepts unauthenticated connections, then clients may start
sending messages immediately and the server will respond accordingly. However,
the server MAY be configured in a way that it accepts certain requests from
authenticated clients only; in that case, the server will reject any requests
that require authentication by simply responding with an
xref:messages/ack.adoc#ack-nak[`ACK-NAK`] message.

A server may provide multiple methods for clients to authenticate themselves;
typical examples are:

* basic username-password submission

* http://jwt.info[JWT tokens]

* TLS client certificate authentication

and so on. Clients can get information about the set of supported authentication
methods and whether authentication is mandatory by sending an
<<auth-inf,`AUTH-INF`>> message. It is also possible to ask the
server whether the current connection is authenticated by sending an
<<auth-whoami,`AUTH-WHOAMI`>> message. These requests are typically
sent during the early stages of a connection so the client can decide whether it
is allowed to send additional requests without authenticating or not.

Authentication can be performed in the server by sending one or more
_authentication requests_ in the form of <<auth-req,`AUTH-REQ`>> messages.
Some authentication types (like the basic username-password submission)
require a single authentication request only as the request will contain all the
information that is needed by the server to decide whether the client is really
who she claims to be or not; in these cases, the server replies with a
single <<auth-resp,`AUTH-RESP`>> message that grants or denies access.
Other authentication methods may be multi-step, requiring several rounds of
challenge-response rounds between the client and the server. In such cases,
the client typically initiates the authentication with an empty
<<auth-req,`AUTH-REQ`>> message that contains the name of the authentication
method only, and the server will send the first authentication challenge to
the client in an <<auth-resp,`AUTH-RESP`>> message. The client must then
send an appropriate response to the challenge in its next <<auth-req,`AUTH-REQ`>>
message; the process continues until the server either accepts or denies the
connection with an appropriate <<auth-resp,`AUTH-RESP`>> message.

For more details about the supported authentication methods, see
xref:security.adoc[the chapter about security considerations].

[#auth-inf]
== `AUTH-INF` — Query supported authentication methods

A client sends this request to the server to determine the list of authentication
methods supported by the server, and whether authentication is required in
order to use the server.

[#auth-req]
== `AUTH-REQ` — Send an authentication request

A client sends this request to start an authentication session or to continue
an existing one if the server responded to the previous authentication request
with a challenge.

The request MAY include a session ID; this is used to let clients indicate that
an authentication request belongs to the same multi-step authentication
process as one of the previous messages with the same session ID. Typically,
servers will keep track of only one authentication request per client
connection, and in the absence of a session ID, they will simply assume that
the request belongs to the multi-step authentication session that is already
in progress, so there is no need to send a session ID by default. The only time
when you _do_ need to send a session ID is when you want to _abandon_ a
multi-step authentication procedure and start a new one (with possibly a
different method); in that case, you MUST include a session ID that is different
from the one used before so the server knows not to consider your request as a
continuation of the previous multi-step authentication attempt.

*Request fields*

[#auth-resp]
== `AUTH-RESP` — Send a response to an authentication request

This message is sent by the server in response to an <<auth-req,AUTH-REQ>>
message.

For successful authentication attempts, the server will return an object where
the `result` key set to `true`, and also set the `user` key to the
username and domain that it now considers authenticated. For failed
authentication attempts, the server will return an objet where the `result`
key is set to `false`. For multi-step authentication methods, the server
may also send an additional challenge to the client by omitting the `result`
key and sending a `data` key instead with the challenge.

*Request fields*

This message is never sent as a request; see <<auth-req,AUTH-REQ>>.

*Response fields*

[width="100%",cols="15%,10%,25%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Required? |Type |Description
|`data` |no |string |Challenge provided by the server that acts as an
input for the next step of a multi-step authentication process.
|`result` |no |boolean |Whether the authentication was successful.
|`user` |no |string |Username and domain that the server associates to the connection
after a successful authentication.
|===

`result` and `data` are mutually exclusive; one of them MUST be present in the
response, but both of them MUST NOT be present at the same time.

If `result` is `true`, the `user` key MUST be present, otherwise it MUST be
absent.

[#auth-whoami]
== `AUTH-WHOAMI` — Query the user associated to the connection

A client sends this request to the server to query the name and domain of
the user that is associated to the current connection.

Usernames and domains provided in the response are formatted as `name@domain`.
The domain part and the preceding `@` is omitted if the domain is empty.
Unauthenticated connections will return an empty string.
