= `ASYNC` — Messages related to asynchronous operations

The messages in this chapter are related to the handling of
xref:async.adoc[asynchronous operations]; please read that chapter for more
details.

[#async-cancel]
== `ASYNC-CANCEL` — Cancellation of an asynchronous operation

A client sends this request to the server when it is not interested in the result
of an asynchronous operation any more. It is up to the server to decide whether
the cancellation is supported and what its effect would be; in certain cases it
can be safer to continue with the operation and simply not inform the client
about further progress and results, while in other cases it might make more sense
to terminate the operation altogether.

The server responds to an `ASYNC-CANCEL` request with an `ASYNC-CANCEL` response,
listing the receipt IDs of all the operations that have been cancelled successfully
and also the IDs of all the operations where cancellation was not possible.
For operations that have been cancelled prematurely, the server will also need
to dispatch an appropriate <<async-resp,ASYNC-RESP>> response with a cancellation error to
make it easier for clients to handle cancellations the same way as any other
error condition. In other words, the response to `ASYNC-CANCEL` simply
acknowledges that the server has received and processed the cancellation request,
and the actual cancellation will result in an <<async-resp,ASYNC-RESP>>
notification. This way it is guaranteed that each receipt ID appears sooner or
later in either an <<async-resp,ASYNC-RESP>> or an <<async-timeout,ASYNC-TIMEOUT>>
notification.

[#async-resp]
== `ASYNC-RESP` — Result of an asynchronous operation

A server sends this notification to a client when an asynchronous operation
initiated earlier by the client has finished, either successfully or with an
error.

*Notification fields*

[width="100%",cols="15%,10%,25%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Required? |Type |Description
|`id` |yes |string |The receipt ID that the message refers to

|`result` |no |object |The result of the asynchronous operation identified by the receipt ID

|`error` |no |string |The error message returned by the asynchronous operation identified by the receipt ID
|===

Exactly one of the `result` and the `error` keys MUST be present in the message.

[#async-st]
== `ASYNC-ST` — Status information for an asynchronous operation

A server sends this notification to a client to update the client about the
progress of an asynchronous operation or to inform the client that the
execution of the operation has been suspended and is waiting for additional
input from the client.

[#async-timeout]
== `ASYNC-TIMEOUT` — Timeout notification for one or more asynchronous operations

A server sends this notification to a client when an asynchronous operation
initiated earlier by the client has timed out.
