== `DEV-INF` — Retrieve the current value of a channel or device path

A client sends this request to the server to retrieve the current value
of a channel or the current values of all channels that are in a subtree
of a device node in the device tree. The server will respond with an
appropriately formatted JSON object that is structured in exactly the
same way as the part of the matched device tree that the client is
interested in. For instance, if the client requests the current value of
a device node that has four channels with names `ch1`, `ch2`, `ch3` and
`ch4`, then the response object will also have four keys with names
`ch1`, `ch2`, `ch3` and `ch4`.

A server sends notifications of this type to the client whenever a
channel in the part of the device tree that the client is subscribed to
was updated (see `DEV-SUB`, `DEV-UNSUB` and `DEV-LISTSUB` for managing
subscriptions).

All the device tree paths that were specified in the request MUST appear
_either_ in the `status` list or in the `error` map. When this
message is sent as a notification, only the `status` field SHOULD be
present.

== `DEV-LIST` — List of devices and channels

A client sends this request to the server to retrieve the list (well,
more precisely, the _tree_) of devices and channels associated to one or
more objects.

corresponding device tree could not have been retrieved.

All the object IDs that were specified in the request MUST appear _either_
in the `status` list or in the `error` map.

== `DEV-LISTSUB` — List device tree subscriptions

A client sends this request to the server to retrieve the list of device
tree paths that the client is subscribed to.

The list of paths returned may optionally be filtered to parts of the
device tree. A subscription path will be included in the result if it
matches at least one of the specified paths. When no path is supplied in
the request, the default path filter is `["/"]`, which will match all
subscription paths.

A path MUST be included as many times in the request as the number of
subscription requests sent by the client to this path.

*Request fields*

|Name |Required? |Type |Description
|`pathFilter` |no |list of strings |The list of device or channel paths
that the client is interested in. Only subscriptions that refer to these
paths or subtrees of these paths will be returned in the response. The
default value is `["/"]`.

*Response fields*

[width="100%",cols="15%,10%,25%,50%",options="header",]

|Name |Required? |Type |Description
|`paths` |yes |list of strings |The list of device or channel paths that
the client is subscribed to and that match at least one of the path
filters specified in the request. A path will be returned as many times
as the number of subscriptions for the path, multiplied by the number of
path filters that match the pathfootnote:[Typically, this is not a
problem if you ensure that the path filters match disjoint parts of the
tree.].

== `DEV-SUB` — Subscribe to a part of a device tree

A client sends this request to the server to subscribe to changes in the
values of channels in a given part of the device tree of a given object.

The channel and/or device paths specified in the request are added to a
client-specific list of subscriptions in the server. When a value of a
channel is modified on one of the devices, the server will find all the
clients that are subscribed to the channel with at least one
subscription, and send an appropriate `DEV-INF` notification to them.
Note that only one notification will be sent even if there are multiple
subscriptions of the client that matches the channel that was modified.
However, it is possible to subscribe to the same path multiple times.

The server MUST NOT accept nonexistent paths in the `paths` array by
default. However, if the `lazy` request field is set to `true`, the
server MUST accept nonexistent paths and subscribe the client to these
paths when the paths come into existence later in the device tree. This
allows a client to subscribe to channels from a UAV even when the server
has not received telemetry status from the UAV yet.

the subscription failed for these paths.

== `DEV-UNSUB` — Unsubscribe from a part of a device tree

A client sends this request to the server to stop receiving
notifications changes in the values of channels in a given part of the
device tree of a given object.

The channel and/or device paths specified in the request are removed
from a client-specific list of subscriptions in the server. Only exact
matches are considered, i.e. it is not possible to subscribe to a larger
part of the tree and then unsubscribe from a subset of it. Since it is
possible to subscribe to the same path multiple times, and the paths a
client subscribed to are stored in a list, the same number of
unsubscription requests are required to cancel the subscription, unless
`"removeAll": true` is specified in the request, in which case all exact
matches will be removed.

*Request fields*

[width="100%",cols="15%,10%,25%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Required? |Type |Description
|`paths` |yes |list of strings |The list of device or channel paths that
the client wants to unsubscribe from

|`removeAll` |no |boolean |Whether to remove all subscriptions that are
exact matches to the paths specified in `paths`. The default is `false`,
in which case the same number of unsubscription requests are required as
the number of currently active subscriptions.

|`includeSubtrees` |no |boolean |Whether to also remove all
subscriptions that are in the subtrees of the paths specified in the
request. The default is `false`.
|===

*Response fields*

[width="100%",cols="15%,10%,25%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Required? |Type |Description
|`success` |no |list of strings |The list of paths that the client was
successfully unsubscribed from. This list may include paths that were
not in the original `paths` list if `includeSubtrees` was `true`.

|`error` |no |object |Object mapping failed paths to explanations about why
the subscription failed for these paths.
