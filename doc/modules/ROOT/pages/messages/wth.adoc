= `WTH` — Weather station related messages

Weather stations use a combination of instruments to provide basic measurements
about the current weather and also to provide short-term forecasts. The messages
listed in this section are specific to weather stations and do not apply to
other object types.

== `WTH-AT` - Current weather at a given geograpical coordinate.

A client sends this request to the server to obtain information about the current
weather at the given geographical coordinate. If there is no weather station at
the given coordinate, the server MAY use data from the nearest weather station,
interpolate information from multiple nearby weather stations, or turn to an
external service such as https://openweathermap.org[OpenWeatherMap] to provide
weather data at the given location.

The response contains an object of type xref:types.adoc#_weather[`Weather`].
Weather objects provide a `position` field; this may or may not be identical
to the position in the request. When the position is identical, it indicates that
the weather object was interpolated from nearby weather stations or that there
was an exact match for the given coordinate. When the position is not identical,
it indicates that the weather object was obtained from a single nearby weather
station, and the position shows the coordinate of the weather station.

== `WTH-INF` - Basic status information of one or more weather stations.

A client sends this request to the server to obtain basic status information
about one or more weather stations currently known to the server. The basic
status information includes measurements about the _current_ weather
conditions near the station.

All the weather station IDs that were specified in the request MUST appear
_either_ in the `status` list or in the `error` map.
