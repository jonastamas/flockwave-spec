= `CLK` — Clock and timer-related messages

Flockwave servers may manage a set of clocks (timers); these timers may
be displayed on the user interface in a Flockwave client or may be
broadcast to UAVs in the range of the Flockwave server for
synchronization purposes.

The clocks are assumed to count the number of _clock ticks_ that have
elapsed since a specified or an unknown _epoch_ in the past. Each clock
is able to report how many clock ticks correspond to a second in "wall
clock time". When the epoch of a clock is known, the epoch, the number
of ticks per second and the number of ticks since the epoch can be used
to map the state of the clock into wall clock time. Clocks with unknown
epochs can only be mapped into the number of seconds that have elapsed
since the epoch by multiplying the tick count with the number of ticks
per second.

Clocks are identified by unique string identifiers (just like objects or
connections). The following reserved clock IDs are defined in the
Flockwave protocol:

* `system` corresponds to the internal clock of the server. It MUST be
measured in seconds since the Unix epoch (one tick per second) and it
must be expressed in UTC even if the operating system of the server is
set up to display the internal clock in a different timezone.
* `gps` corresponds to time as reported by a GPS receiver. It MUST be
measured in seconds since the Unix epoch. Note that this is true
irrespectively of the fact that GPS time is different from UTC time
(because GPS time is not perturbed by leap seconds), so if you have the
number of seconds from the GPS epoch as reported by a GPS receiver, you
must correct it not only by the difference between the GPS epoch (6 Jan
1980) and the Unix epoch (1 Jan 1970) but also by the number of leap
seconds since the GPS epoch. Typically, GPS receivers also report the
exact difference between GPS and UTC time so this should not be a
problem.
* `mtc` corresponds to a clock that expresses MIDI time code in a given
framerate (typically 24, 25 or 30 frames per second). In most cases it
has no known epoch (although it may have one) and it is typically used
to synchronize the movement and lighting of drones in a drone show with
an external time source.

Any other clock ID not listed explicitly above is free to be used for
any purpose.

== `CLK-INF` — Retrieve status of a timer

A client sends this request to the server to retrieve the status of one
or more clocks or timers managed by the server.

This message may also be broadcast as a notification by the server on
its own volition to all connected Flockwave clients to notify them about
a status change of one of the clocks. This may happen if a clock is
started or stopped or if the value of the clock has drifted or has been
adjusted significantly.
