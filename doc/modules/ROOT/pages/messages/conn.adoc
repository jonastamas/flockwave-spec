== `CONN-INF` — Basic status information of one or more connections

A client sends this request to the server to obtain basic status
information about one or more connections (e.g., radio links, RTK correction
data streams) currently managed by the server.

This message may also be broadcast as a notification by the server on
its own volition to all connected Flockwave clients to notify them about
a status change of one of the managed connections.
